# !!! Does not work with SDL 2.0.6 at the moment !!!
 - There is a bug with SDL 2.0.6 version in Audio subsystem which makes game crash / not play sound
 - If you have SDL 2.0.6 then downgrade to 2.0.5

# Tech

  - SDL2 Libraries (SDL2, SDL_Image, SDL_TTF, SDL_Mixer, SDL2_Gfx) for graphics, input, font and audio
  - Box2D Library for Physics
  - Tinyxml library for data-driven approach

# Building and running
For all platforms you will need original CLAW.REZ game archive from original game
### Windows
  - Project contains VS2013 solution with all libraries and include directories preset
  - Box2D is generated by CMake and it hardcodes the file paths. If you want to compile it on your own, you must run CMake on the CMakeLists.txt in the Box2D root directory

### Linux
  **Prerequisites for Ubuntu 16.04 (should be almost identical for Fedora/CentOS/*):**
  
  `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev  libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libtinyxml-dev` 
  
  **Compilation:**
  
  - git clone https://github.com/pjasicek/OpenClaw.git
  - cd OpenClaw
  - mkdir build
  - cd build
  - cmake ..
  - make -j4 (for best performance, replace "4" with whatever number of simultaneous threads your machine can run)
  - cd ../Build_Release
  - ./openclaw (Considering you have CLAW.REZ from original game in the same folder)

 **Remarks:**

  - For hearing background music play, you need to install **timidity (or timidity++)** and **freepats**. Some linux distributions come with it by default, some do not (fedora, archlinux)
  
### Android
  
  - Compilation / Deployment steps will be updated in near future, game itself is successfully running on Android

# Claw Launcher

  - Precompiled for Windows natively and for Linux use thorugh Mono runtime
  - Locates Claw binary and corresponding config.xml file
  - Provides GUI to modify configuration (Video/Audio/Assets)

### For Linux

  **Prerequisites for Ubuntu 16.04 (should be almost identical for Fedora/CentOS/*):**
  
  `sudo apt install mono-runtime libmono-system4.0-cil libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil` 
  
  **Then run it like this:**
  
  `~/OpenClaw/Build_Release$ mono ClawLauncher.exe`
